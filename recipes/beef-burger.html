    <h1>Beef Burger</h1>
    <img src="../img/beef-burger.jpg" alt="A juice beef burger with fries and a beer.">
    <p>All you need for great beef hamburgers is decent beef and lots of salt and pepper. This is the way it's done by all the grilling masters like Bobby Flay, and your favourite diners! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <h3>For hamburger pattie:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>800g - 1kg / 1.6 - 2 lb ground beef (mince), 20%+ fat</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>3 onions, peeled and sliced into rings</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>4 - 8 slices cheese of choice, I use Swiss (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For hamburger:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 soft hamburger buns, lightly toasted</li>
        <li>Lettuce, tomato slices</li>
        <li>Ketchup, mustard, relish, sliced pickles</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>On the side:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>French fries</li>
        <li>Baked potato wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Separate beef into 4 equal portions. Use hands to lightly form into patties the size of your buns (mine are about 10 cm / 4") - don't press hard, light fingers = soft juicy patties (see video for how I do this).</li>
        <li>Season generously with salt and pepper on both sides. Make a dent on one side (stop burger from become dome shape and shrinking when cooking).</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a heavy based skillet or BBQ over high heat. Add onion and cook until wilted and caramelised. Season with salt and pepper, then remove.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil until smoking. Add patties and cook for 2 minutes until deep golden with a great crust. Do not press! Flip carefully, cook for 1 minute then top with cheese (if using). Cover with lid and cook for further 1 minute until cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, toast the cut side of the buns lightly.</li>
        <li>To serve: Spread base of buns with sauce / condiment of choice. Top with lettuce then tomato, then hamburger patty. Pile over onions, sliced pickles, then more sauce/condiments. Top with lid of bun. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
